This repository contains the wikitext source for the post at https://jakecoppinger.com/2025/11/list-of-pedestrian-cyclist-and-personal-mobility-device-road-deaths-in-nsw-in-2025/

For the avoidance of any doubt, the intent of this page is not to highlight or blame individuals involved in crashes, but to highlight the prevalence of these crashes and their commonalities, and the need for systematic change to address this road safety 'blind spot'.
