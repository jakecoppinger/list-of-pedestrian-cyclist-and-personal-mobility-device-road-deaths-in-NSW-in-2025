The intention of this reference is to assist journalists, advocates and the wider public by providing a clear and concise list with links to police press releases and daily road fatality statistics. Currently, NSW Police press releases are deleted or disappear after some months, and daily road death statistics are also deleted daily. All urls have been saved to (or retrieved from) the [https://archive.org/about/ Internet Archive], a non-profit, where possible. I believe a reference of this information is in the public interest. Unfortunately it is currently almost impossible for an individual to keep track of press releases of road deaths across all modes.

For the avoidance of any doubt, the intent of this page is not to highlight or blame individuals involved in crashes, but to highlight the prevalence of these crashes and their commonalities, and the need for systematic change to address this road safety 'blind spot'.

If adding a NSW Police press release, make sure to archive it.

==NSW Centre for Road Safety Statistics==
===Eligibility of fatalities reporting in daily statistics===
Fatalities are removed from daily NSW Centre for Road Safety statistics<ref>{{cite web
|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/statistics
|title=NSW Centre for Road Safety Statistics
|publisher=Transport for NSW
}}</ref> if subsequent police or coronial investigation shows that they did not fall within National reporting guidelines. Fatalities are added from a crash occurring prior to the day's date where a person subsequently dies within 30 days or the crash is reported late. Fatalities are deaths which occurred within 30 days of a crash as a result of injuries received in the crash. The crash must have occurred within the surveyed road reserve.<ref name="RoadTollDailyIncluding20251030"/>{{rp|1}}

===Daily publication of statistics===
Daily road fatality statistics are deleted daily. Updates are published in the morning and afternoon. Morning statistics documents are one page long.<ref>{{cite web

==Publication of Police press releases==
As of November 2025, NSW Police press releases are deleted or disappear after some months, and return "Oops, we appear to be experiencing technical difficulties".<ref name="WaterfallCyclistDeath20250114"/><ref name="NSWPoliceFatalPedestrianCrashAtNowra20250117"/><ref name="NSWPoliceFatalPedestrianCrashAtGlenugie20250118"/><ref name="NSWPoliceFatalPedestrianCrashAtLiverpool20250523"/> NSW Police press releases are republished by other news organisations. For example, Mirage News articles republishing these press releases include a link to the original press release, and where NSW Police press releases are still available, the body text is identical.<ref name="MirageNewsUlmarraFatalCrash20251028"/><ref name="UlmarraFatalCrash20251028"/>
